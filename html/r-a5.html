<p>Sec. 134-201.2. - RA-5 single-family attached/detached residential district.</p>
<p>The regulations for the RA-5 single-family attached/detached residential district are as follows:</p>
<p>Purpose and intent. The RA-5 district is established to provide locations for the</p>
<p>development of affordable single-family detached or attached residential dwelling units,</p>
<p>including the combination of duplexes, triplexes and quadraplexes. The dwelling units are</p>
<p>to be designed so as to be placed on an individual lot attached to another dwelling unit or</p>
<p>on an adjoining lot where the units will be attached by a common party wall. This</p>
<p>residential use is designed to be located within or on the edge of properties delineated for</p>
<p>any residential categories as defined and shown on the Cobb County Comprehensive Plan:</p>
<p>A Policy Guide, adopted November 27, 1990. When residentially compatible institutional</p>
<p>and recreational uses are developed within the RA-5 district, they should be designed and</p>
<p>built to ensure intensity and density compatibility with adjacent single-family detached</p>
<p>dwellings and otherwise to implement the stated purpose and intent of this chapter.</p>
<p>Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have</p>
<p>the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly</p>
<p>indicates a different meaning:</p>
<p>Community fair means a festival or fair, such as the North Georgia State Fair,</p>
<p>conducted wholly within public areas owned by a local government, provided that any</p>
<p>activity is conducted at least 200 feet from any property line. Any event shall not</p>
<p>exceed 21 days.</p>
<p>Customary home occupations means those occupations which are customarily</p>
<p>performed in a small area of a residence due to the low intensity nature of such uses,</p>
<p>subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p>There shall be no exterior evidence of the home occupation, including but not</p>
<p>limited to any type of identifying signs.</p>
<p>No article, product or service used or sold in connection with such activity shall be</p>
<p>other than those normally found on the premises.</p>
<p>No mechanical equipment shall be used for such occupation except such</p>
<p>equipment as is customary for purely household and hobby purposes.</p>
<p>Such use shall be conducted entirely within the dwelling unit and only persons</p>
<p>living in the dwelling unit shall be employed in such occupation.</p>
<p>No more than 25 percent of the dwelling unit may be used for the operation.</p>
<p>No materials, equipment or business vehicles may be stored or parked on the</p>
<p>premises except that one business vehicle used exclusively by the resident may be</p>

<p>staff, who live together as a single housekeeping unit and in a long term, family-like</p>

<p>to live as independently as possible in order to reach their maximum potential under</p>
<p>the direction and guidance of a designated managing caregiver, who must be a</p>
<p>resident of the group home. The term "group home" shall not include a halfway house,</p>

<p>the dwelling as a home for individuals on parole, probation, or convicted and released</p>
<p>from incarceration, for any crimes including child molestation, aggravated child</p>
<p>molestation, or child sexual abuse, as defined in O.C.G.A. § 16-6-4 or individuals</p>
<p>required to register as sex offenders pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 42-1-12. A group home</p>
<p>may include a home for the handicapped. As used in this subsection, the term</p>
<p>"handicapped" shall mean:</p>
<p>Having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of</p>
<p>such person's major life activities so that such person is incapable of living</p>
<p>independently;</p>
<p>Having a record of having such an impairment; or</p>
<p>Being regarded as having such an impairment.</p>
<p>However, the term "handicapped" shall not include current illegal use of or</p>
<p>addiction to a controlled substance, nor shall it include any person whose</p>
<p>residency in the home would constitute a direct threat to the health and safety of</p>
<p>other individuals.</p>

<p>total pavement and roof areas (pervious and impervious) exceed 45 percent.</p>
<p>Required buffers may be included within required setbacks; however, in such case that</p>
<p>the required buffer is greater than the required setback, the required buffer shall be</p>
